# Photos CLI tool
CLI tool to batch manipulate photos.

## Features
- Rename photos to the moment they are taken in a standard form, `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.extension`
- 2 types of suffixes.
  - A custom suffix to get the following form, `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-suffix.extension`
  - An automatic suffix with the device name that you made the photo with, coming from the exif data. Final form `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-device.extension`
- Adjust the data taken of a photo in the EXIF data. Useful if you forgot to change summer/winter time on your camera.
